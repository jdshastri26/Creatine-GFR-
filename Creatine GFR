Python script to calculate eGFR based on the CKD-EPI equation for a female patient aged 45 with a serum creatinine level of 2.7 mg/dL:

def calculate_egfr(creatinine, age, sex, race='non-black'):
    # CKD-EPI equation constants
    k = 0.7 if sex == 'female' else 0.9
    alpha = -0.329 if sex == 'female' else -0.411
    min_creatinine = min(creatinine / k, 1)
    max_creatinine = max(creatinine / k, 1)
    
     race == 'asian':
        race_factor = 1.159

    
    # CKD-EPI equation
    egfr = 141 * (min_creatinine ** alpha) * (max_creatinine ** -1.209) * (0.993 ** age) * race_factor
    return egfr

# Patient data
creatinine = 2.7  # mg/dL
age = 45
sex = 'female'

# Calculate eGFR
egfr = calculate_egfr(creatinine, age, sex)

print(f"The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is {egfr:.2f} mL/min/1.73m²")

In this specific scenario:

    The patient is a 45-year-old female.
    Serum creatinine level is 2.7 mg/dL.
    The patient is asian.
